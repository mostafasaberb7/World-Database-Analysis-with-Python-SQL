# 🌍 World Database Analysis Using SQL + Python

This project showcases how I used **raw SQL queries** to analyze global data from the classic **SQL World Database**, and then visualized the results using **Python**.

## 📌 Project Overview

I wrote custom **SQL queries** to explore the relationships between countries, cities, populations, and languages. After retrieving the data directly from the database, I used **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)** to perform additional analysis and build visual insights.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- ✅ SQL 
- ✅ Python 3.x
- ✅ MySQL Connector / SQLAlchemy
- ✅ pandas
- ✅ matplotlib & seaborn
- ✅ Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 What I Did

- Wrote custom **SQL JOINs** and aggregation queries
- Filtered and sorted data using `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY`
- Connected SQL output to Python using pandas
- Built **data visualizations** from SQL results

## 🔍 Insights I Extracted

- 🌐 Top 10 Most Spoken Languages in the World
- 🏙️ Top 10 Most Populated Cities
- 🗣️ Countries with Highest % of Arabic & English Speakers
- 📉 Bottom 10 Languages by Total Speakers
